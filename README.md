# Preflight

Very simple script to check for known error conditions and if they are found
print an error message with resolution instructions or a link to the JIRA 
tickets.

Not supported in any way but useful nevertheless...

# Usage
Just run the script:
`./preflight.sh`

# Requirements
* curl
* awk
* bash
